# Course Website using React Router Dom
In this module, a website with various Courses were segregated in Navigation bar. Based on the selection of respective Segment, the corresponding list of courses will be displayed.

React Router Dom is used to route across various pages. Loaded the courses within same root element using Outlet. NavLink is used to route from one page to another link.

Highlighted the Active navigation link using CSS style props.

Created a separate page for Careers to list out the Open Roles.

Maintained the course selection within State and used ContextAPI to pass the data across different components
